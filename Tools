The creation of the Elderly Care App, which incorporates image recognition algorithms 
for eye illness diagnosis and individualized medication reminder features, calls for a 
variety of tools and technologies to guarantee its usability, usefulness, and 
accessibility. In order to complete various tasks related to the development of the app, 
the following tools and technologies might be used:
Programming Languages:
- Python: Used for implementing image recognition algorithms and backend logic.
- Java: Used for frontend development, creating interactive user interfaces.
Mobile App Development:
- React Native: A popular framework for building cross-platform mobile apps that 
works on both iOS and Android platforms.
- Swift (iOS) and Java/Kotlin (Android): If native development is preferred, these 
languages can be used for iOS and Android platforms, respectively.
Image Recognition:
- OpenCV: An open-source computer vision library used for image processing and 
analysis.
- TensorFlow or PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks that can be used for training and 
deploying image recognition models.
Backend Development:
- Flask or Django:Python-based web frameworks for developing the backend APIs and 
services.
-RESTful APIs: To facilitate communication between frontend and backend 
components.
Database:
- SQLite or PostgreSQL: Lightweight databases for storing user data, medication 
schedules, and eye image metadata
